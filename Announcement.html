AN ANNOUNCEMENT
</h1>
<p class="intro"> 
As mentioned a few weeks ago, I’ve got an important announcement to make. 
</p>
<p class="intro">
After several discussions with friends in the games industry and a great deal of thinking about what constitutes a “successful experience” in this rapidly growing field of independent game development, I’ve come to the following conclusion: 
</p>
<p class="intro">
Starting on November 1st 2013 and for the duration of one year, I’ll be concentrating on a large-scale game which will be loosely based on my 48 hour Ludum Dare entry “Cedarville”. 
</p>
<p class="intro">
You can play Cedarville here:

<h1>
2013 FOR ME IN GAMES
</h1>
<p class="main">
Up until this point I’ve never spent more than a month working on a game because for me 2013 has been more of a “refinement” and a “craft-learning” period. Although I’ve been tinkering with development for quite a few years now, I needed the output, portfolio and the feeling of accomplishment from having already made some significant first steps in the field. As a result, this year has been a whirlwind of game-related activity: I’ve made roughly 25-30 games in all sorts of genres, have written 23 HTML5 development tutorials and have participated in 8 game jams to date. Needless to say, I’ve learned a lot and have come into contact with a number of great talents throughout this period. 
</p>
<p class="main">
However, I have yet to work on a large-scale game – a game which requires months of dedication. This will be a project I can watch evolve over time, struggle with, fall in love with, constantly change, then step back from, observe from a distance and aim to improve until it’s a final, concrete product. 
</p>

<h1>
VALUE
</h1>
<p class="main">
By doing this I hope to have ultimately created something of value. And once I’m successful at creating an enjoyable game which can be objectively identifiable as a high-value product, I’ll begin marketing it through a number of venues, both physical and online.
</p>
<p class="main">
Every game has its worth and I think a dominant flaw in many developers is to view their own work’s value only in relation to the often huge amount of energy necessary to complete it. Strangely, the actual programming/mechanics/game design has little effect on the appeal and value that the games provide. Sometimes even the simplest and most cliché game mechanics can be drastically improved through the use of enthralling music, a charismatic main character and “flashier” elements like dazzling particle effects or professional voice acting.
</p>
<p class="main">
So what constitutes value for a video game? What could you replace a game with and be entirely satisfied? A bar of soap? A bicycle? A sports car?  How many, if any, complete days/hours or pay would you go without in order to be able to enjoy the experience of playing a game? This ultimately translates into the game’s value.
</p>
<p class="main">
To date, absolutely none of my games have shown to be of substantial value. However, this is simply due to the fact that I haven’t set out to make anything of substantial value yet. This can also be seen by my complete lack of monetization strategy throughout the year. Of course I’ve had some extremely valuable experiences making these games, but these experiences are rarely transmitted to others to the degree that they generate profit for me. My games are often playable in the arc of 5 minutes, not enough care is given to the story or the artwork, often there are very few levels, there is a lack of polish, etc. I could go on and on about how valueless my games have been until now. But as mentioned before, my aim for 2013 was not to create value, but to refine the tools necessary for creating it.
</p>
<p class="main">
Fortunately I haven’t been so arrogant as to ignore the criticism which has swept over my games. The internet criticism of independent games tends to strike hard and I’ve certainly taken my fair share of crushing insults. However, although I’ve been disappointed by these comments, they’ve contributed to my awareness and have helped me develop a clearer idea of what truly constitutes value.  
</p>
<p class="main">
The truth of the matter is that I’m not an exception; there are general rules which apply to value itself which are completely ignored by...and dare I say it...the overwhelming majority of independent game developers. 
It’s by separating oneself from the concept of workload-based/time invested-based value and building a game which will be perceived as valuable to a group of people, that one’s share of success in this field is to be had.
</p>
<p class="main">
Through months and months of close scrutiny, I believe I’ve pinpointed the common characteristics of successful games. Needless to say I’ll be applying very strict principals of value generation derived from this investigation to my next project.
</p>
<h1>
THE GAME
</h1>
<p class="main">
Cedarville will be a one man show. All the art, music and coding will be done by me. And since the duration of this project will be a year, I’ll have plenty of time to make it exactly the way I want it to be. I’ve already started to do the research and it has taken me on an interesting exploration of topics such as ornamentation, history, architecture, linguistics and cinematography. The outline of the narrative has already been sketched and I’m just starting to fill in the countless details. It will be an eclectic game, but one with a tight, compelling, though often abstract narrative – a game which won’t be classifiable as belonging to a single genre, but rather as a hodge-podge of elements which, when viewed as a whole, will form a complete and solid, though perhaps not immediately understandable work.
</p>
<p class="main">
I realize that this will not be a game for everyone:  some people will be turned off by the abstraction and lack of apparently clear plot. Others will find that its deviance from traditional game genres will limit its entertainment value. 
It will not follow the adventure game/text game format explored in the 48 hour version of Cedarville, but will direct the players through various psychological states by employing of a number of character perspectives. The temporal element will be dealt with in a very particular way as well. Perhaps the only string that will connect the new Cedarville to the old one is that it will take place in the same town.
</p>
<p class="main"> 
I do believe this game will find its niche because there are those out there who are craving something new – a departure from the boring recycling of genres, the obsession with “retro” and backwards-looking games.  As with anything in the entertainment business, there are groundbreakers and there are thousands of imitators in line aiming to make a profit. My aim in this venture, after having spent this year refining my craft, is to push things to the new level and to move from imitator to groundbreaker.
</p>
<p class="main">
I want this game to be something that can be admired and, at the risk of appearing full of myself, appreciated as art. Yes, these are high standards, but since video games are a relatively new phenomenon, as cinema was at the turn of the past century, there is plenty of space for development and innovation – in almost any direction! Just look at where cinema, <i>real</i> cinema, has taken us since the Lumiere brothers. Look at the Eisensteins, the Lynches, the Bressons, the Ozus… Perhaps we could one day reach the point where interactive experiences such as the ones we make will no longer be called “games” and could no longer serve entertainment purposes, but also be considered <i>edifying experiences</i>. When we walk through an art museum, read the signs, wait our turn to see the works, maneuver through the crowd, admire the sculptures from 360 degrees, we are, in fact, playing the museum. Yet the experience is often seen as a lesser, more trivial one. Why can’t the same hold true for games?
</p>
<h1>
MY VIEWS ON GAMES
</h1>
<p class="main">
Games, in my opinion have an enormous potential for artistic expression, but have been tied down to a comic book/Hollywood/retro game (cannibalistic) narrative approach which has stifled their creativity. Why can’t games have a voice of their own that can stand on their own feet next to cinema, literature or music? Games have an element of interactivity which distinguishes them from other art forms. It’s a shame that this interactivity is often wasted on perpetuating the same old clichés. Why do games only need to be often mass-consumed, ephemeral entertainment? Why can’t a game be something you repeatedly go back to for reference or intellectual stimulation? Although it’s true that video games today are a very different experience compared to the earliest years, why do they need to be linked to specific group of people (“gamers”)? Why not games which can be enjoyed by people in their 50s-60s? Why not games which can be placed side-by-side with visual art? There are so many new paths to be explored that it boggles the mind.
</p> 
<p class="main">
Fortunately, with the advent and rise of independent games in recent years, it appears that a part of this landscape is changing. With works by Jason Rohrer, Paolo Pedercini and a number of developers showcased in the IndieCade festival, etc. small currents seem to be shifting in a different direction. 
</p>
<p class="main">
I’m hoping with Cedarville to add to this rift by exploring new narrative styles, appealing to emotions which have not yet been addressed in games and helping to bring games closer to that which we label “art”.
</p>
<h1>
NEXT STEPS
</h1>
<p class="main">
It’s also worth mentioning that although this project will begin on November 1st, I still have two smaller games to commit to for November and December. These will also serve as my final “One Game A Month” submissions, rounding off a full year of activity. After this I’ll retire from the challenge in order to fully concentrate on the Cedarville project. 
</p>
<p class="main">
I’ve been preparing myself mentally throughout the month, and have also done a great deal of brainstorming about the general layout of the project as I mentioned before.
</p>
<p class="main">
After I’ve accumulated enough material, and if that material happens to be appealing enough for a Kickstarter campaign, I’ll start one for a reasonably small amount of money. This will cover a number of research and material fees necessary to complete the project. And if my cup runneth over, I’ll dedicate the extra funds to making the game even more impressive, possibly even extending the Nov 1, 2014 deadline.
</p>
<p class="main">
So that’s where everything stands as of today. If you’d like to follow in my adventures, I’ll be giving updates regularly on Twitter (@benwhi), or on my Warm Sea Orchard Facebook group, so be sure to check those out. You’d also be doing an enormous favor to this project by making a contribution to my Kickstarter campaign if/when it comes out. I’ll try to put together some great prizes and perks (which will, of course, include copies of the actual game) for all those who make a donation.
</p>
<p class="main">
So thank you so much for reading my announcement. I’m really looking forward to beginning this enormous undertaking and sincerely hope you’ll enjoy the final product.
